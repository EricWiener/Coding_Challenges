### FLAPPY BIRD ON ROS 🔥🔥🔥

[Flappy Bird Automation Game](https://github.com/JohsBL/flappy_automation_test)

Flappy Bird is in trouble again! This time it went into space and landed in an asteroid belt. If Flappy Bird collides 
with the asteroids it would be fatal. Luckily Flappy remembered his laser scanner that provides distance measurements.
It will give you its velocity and the laserscans in return for an acceleration input. Flappy Bird only asks for 60 
seconds of your guidance. Help Flappy Bird go through as many asteroid lines as possible before the time runs out!


### POLYGON IOU 🔥🔥🔥

Given two 2D polygons write a function that calculates the IoU of their areas,
defined as the area of their intersection divided by the area of their union.
The vertices of the polygons are constrained to lie on the unit circle and you
can assume that each polygon has at least 3 vertices, given and in sorted order.
- You are free to use basic math functions/libraries (sin, cos, atan2, numpy etc)
  but not geometry-specific libraries (such as shapely).
- You are free to look up geometry-related formulas, optionally copy paste in
  short code snippets and adapt them to your needs.
- We do care and evaluate your general code quality, structure and readability
  but you do not have to go crazy on docstrings.
